        <p className="mb-4">My journey into tech began with crafting websites on Wix and customizing backgrounds on Tumblr, sparked by my fascination after watching a Steve Jobs movie. I've always had a passion for technology, enjoying the thrill of experimenting with anything electronic that I could get my hands on.</p>
